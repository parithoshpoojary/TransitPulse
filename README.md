# TransitPulse

**TransitPulse** is an innovative solution designed to monitor and visualize the real-time locations of public transport vehicles. This project integrates powerful technologies such as Apache Kafka for data streaming, Spring Boot for backend processing, and Angular for front-end visualization, offering a comprehensive and scalable system.

### Features

* **Real-time Data Streaming:** Collects real-time location data from public transport vehicles using Apache Kafka.
* **Scalable and Fault-Tolerant Architecture:** Utilizes Apache Kafka for scalable and fault-tolerant data streaming, ensuring reliable data flow even under heavy load.
* **Data Processing:** Processes and manages incoming vehicle data using Spring Boot microservices, enabling efficient and modular data handling.
* **High-Performance Database:** Stores vehicle data in Cassandra, a highly scalable and distributed NoSQL database, optimized for high-throughput and low-latency.
* **Map Visualization:** Displays real-time vehicle locations on an interactive map using an Angular frontend, providing an intuitive user interface.
* **Dockerized Setup:** Provides Docker and Docker Compose configurations for seamless setup and deployment of Kafka, Cassandra, and the application itself.
* **Extensible and Configurable:** Easily customizable and extensible to suit various public transportation systems, with flexible configuration options for Kafka and Cassandra.
* **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Includes integration with monitoring tools to track system performance and health, ensuring operational reliability.
